LogicalDOC Community Edition is a free (libre) software (FLOSS) application that allows businesses and individuals to centralize document management, storage, retrieval, and dissemination.

With a multilingual, desktop interface and user-friendly features including multilingual full-text indexing, complete version control, task manager, importing from zip files, and document searching, LogicalDoc Community Edition provides a lot for your document management requirements.

LogicalDOC is available in a variety of languages, including Russian, English, Chinese, Korean, Japanese, Italian, and many more, and one of its most intriguing characteristics is its ability to index document content using different algorithms based on the document's language.
This enables for "smart" full-text searches afterwards.

The LogicalDOC Community provides a set of SOAP and REST API interfaces for integrating the system with other applications.
The web-service API documentation may be found at https://docs.logicaldoc.com/en/web-services-api on the LogicalDOC Documentation website.

A WebDAV and a CMIS interface are also provided.
